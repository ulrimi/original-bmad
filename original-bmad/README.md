# BMAD Universal Base Framework

A **project-agnostic foundation** for creating specialized BMAD Method implementations. This base framework provides the core BMAD methodology with story-driven development for any technology stack or domain.

## What is BMAD Method?

**BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-Driven Development)** solves the two biggest problems in AI-assisted development:

1. **Planning Inconsistency** - AI plans are often generic and inconsistent
2. **Context Loss** - Implementation agents lose planning context during handoffs

### BMAD's Solution: Story-Driven Development

BMAD uses **story files** as context carriers that eliminate context loss:

- **Planning Agents** (rich context) create comprehensive PRDs and Architecture documents
- **Scrum Master** converts plans into detailed story files with complete context  
- **Dev Agents** (lean, focused) implement stories autonomously with full understanding
- **QA Agents** validate against story specifications

## Universal Base Framework

This repository is the **universal foundation** that can be cloned and specialized for any domain:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ agents/                     # Universal agents (Master, Architect, Dev)
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/                      # Natural language task definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/                  # Story and document templates
â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/                  # Core BMAD workflows

â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/                      # Domain-specific tasks  
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/                  # E-commerce templates
â””â”€â”€ workflows/                  # E-commerce workflows

bmad-security/                  # Security audit specialization
bmad-api/                       # API development specialization
bmad-gamedev/                   # Game development specialization
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Specialize

```bash
# Clone this base framework
cp -r bmad bmad-yourspecialization

# Customize for your domain
cd bmad-yourspecialization
# Add domain-specific agents, tasks, and templates
```

### 2. Use with LLMs

**For Planning (Web UI)**:
1. Copy `agents/bmad-master.md` content
2. Create new Claude/Gemini/ChatGPT conversation
3. Paste agent content to activate BMAD Master
4. Type `*help` to see capabilities

**For Development (IDE)**:
1. Copy `agents/dev-agent.md` content  
2. Create new Claude/Cursor/VS Code conversation
3. Activate dev agent and provide story files
4. Dev agent implements features autonomously

### 3. Core Workflow

    A[Business Requirements] --> B[*analyze - Analyze Project]
    B --> C[*create doc - Create PRD + Architecture]  
    C --> D[*create story - Break into Stories]
    D --> E[*implement - Dev Agent Implements]
    E --> F[Story Complete]

    style F fill:#e8f5e9
```

## Framework Components

### Agents (Markdown + YAML)

**Planning Agents** (Rich Context - Web UI):
- `bmad-master.md` - Universal project analysis and orchestration
- `architect.md` - System architecture and technical design

**Development Agents** (Lean Context - IDE):  
- `dev-agent.md` - Feature implementation from story files

### Natural Language Tasks

All tasks are **pure natural language** instructions:
- `analyze-project.md` - Analyze any project structure and tech stack
- `create-story.md` - Create comprehensive story files with full context
- `implement-story.md` - Implement features autonomously from stories

### Templates (YAML)

**Structured document generation**:
- `story-template.yaml` - Complete story template with all context sections
- `prd-template.yaml` - Product Requirements Document template  
- `architecture-template.yaml` - System architecture documentation

### Workflows

**Story-driven development process**:
- `story-driven-development.md` - Core BMAD workflow documentation
- `planning-to-implementation.md` - End-to-end process guide

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Project-Agnostic Design
- Works with any programming language or framework
- Adapts to existing codebases and patterns
- Maintains architectural consistency

### ðŸ§  LLM-Native Execution  
- Agents are markdown files with YAML configuration
- No Python orchestration - LLMs execute directly
- Natural language task definitions

### ðŸ“‹ Story-Driven Context Preservation
- Complete implementation context in every story file
- No context loss between planning and development
- Autonomous agent execution with full understanding

### ðŸ”§ Specialization Ready
- Clone base framework for any domain
- Add specialized agents for your needs
- Inherit all core BMAD methodology

## Usage Examples

### Analyze Any Project

```bash
# Activate BMAD Master agent and run:
*analyze

# Provides recommendations for:
# - Technology stack assessment  
# - BMAD implementation strategy
# - Specialized agents needed
# - Custom workflows required
```

### Create Implementation Stories

```bash
# From PRD and Architecture documents:
*create story

# Generates complete story files with:
# - User story and business context
# - Acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then)
# - Technical implementation guidance  
# - Testing requirements
# - Definition of done
```

### Autonomous Implementation

```bash
# Dev agent reads story file and implements:
*implement story-user-auth-001-login.md

# Autonomously creates:
# - Complete feature implementation
# - Comprehensive test coverage
# - Documentation updates
# - Quality validation
```
